Reserve is responsible for the inequities between the mid class and the upper class. - RP*)^@If he is worried about inequality, he should be worried about his corporatism which creates it. - RP*)^@Sounds like European socialism to me… - RP*)^@Does that mean we should lower the income for women who are making more than men?? - RP*)^@So far all we have heard is that we need more govt. spending - yet that is the problem that we are facing. -RP*)^@The Pres. aggressive approach to more fed. involvement  in education is not a good sign for our children's future. - RP*)^@Thank you to all that are commenting along with me on the #SOTU: http://t.co/YFHNLqGfQE*)^@As far as I am concerned, the Pres. is making a great case for homeschooling. - RP*)^@World class education means that he most likely wants the UN involved. -RP*)^@The best way to help the unemployed is to just get out of the way. -RP*)^@You subsidize unemployment - you get more of it. - RP #SOTU*)^@And where is he going to get the money?! It is never a concern to those who profess that big govt will solve all our problems. - RP*)^@The Pres. ought to be concerned to what happened in Detroit will be a foreshadowing to what may come to the whole nation. -RP*)^@A deeply flawed educational system has led to a labor market that is not skilled. -RP*)^@Fancy words but it doesn't mean a thing. - RP*)^@The Pres is quoting deeply flawed science. - RP #SOTU*)^@The higher efficiency standards for our cars have created a more dangerous automobile and led to more deaths. - RP*)^@Politicians and bureaucrats are not smart enough to know what is the most efficient fuel. - RP*)^@This speech sounds like more and more and more government and govt. is the problem. - RP*)^@It is not the business of govt. to ship oil around the world - it is the business of the private sector. -RP*)^@Fed. funding research is always distributed to political friends &amp; is the least effective - think Solyndra… - RP*)^@In the free market, the govt. doesn't make the loans - it comes from the savings of the people. -RP #SOTU*)^@Sounds like more central economic planning to me and it won't work. -RP*)^@He's a dreamer if he thinks he is going to save any money with is tax "reforms". RP*)^@The only real solution is to get rid of the income tax and repeal the 16th amendment. - RP #SOTU*)^@There is no oppritunity without liberty! - RP*)^@He is announced an unwillingness to work with congress and should be held accountable for this. - RP*)^@And how much freedom we have should be included! - RP*)^@Education is not a responsibility of the Fed. govt. It is a responsibility of parents. -RP*)^@Rebs and Dems have done this the same - using executive power/orders to overrule congress - this is a blatant attack on the constitution. RP*)^@He must be reminded that immediately after the preamble of the Constitution that all legislative powers be vested in congress. - RP*)^@This blatant announcement that the constitution means nothing, the law means nothing and he should be held accountable. - RP*)^@That is a very good reason why they should pay more attention to monetary policy and the Fed. Reserve. - RP*)^@That is nothing more than a throwback to the Luddites - we can't blame tech and global competition. - RP*)^@Does it follow the nonaggression principle? Most politicians call for action but they never question if the action is good. - RP*)^@Action alone is nothing - the question is, is it good policy? Is the policy moral or immoral? - RP*)^@The only way the Pres. can restore trust is for us to hear the truth. - RP*)^@Why don't we just follow the Constitution?We would know what the proper size of govt. would be. - RP*)^@The wars are all over?
